How to track changes in your codebase? <br> 
How to collaborate with others on a project? <br> How to manage different versions of your code?

Come, let's find out!

## What is Version Control ?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

### Local Version Control

- Many people‚Äôs goto choice.
- The approach is to **copy files into another directory** (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they‚Äôre clever).
- This approach is very common because it is so simple, but **it is easy to forget which directory you‚Äôre in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don‚Äôt mean to.**

## What is Git?

- By far, the **widely used** modern version control system!
- Distributed Developement
    
    For a centralized VCS, each developer gets a working copy that points back to a single central repository. Git, however, is a distributed version control system.
    
    <aside>
    üìå Instead of a working copy, each developer gets their own local repository, complete with a full history of commits.
    
    </aside>
    
    Having a full local history makes Git fast, since it means you don‚Äôt need a network connection to create commits, inspect previous versions of a file.
    

## What is Github?

- Git is not the same as GitHub.
- GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
- Helps share our code with others

Alright, lot of theory, lets code!

## Getting Started

1. [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and Install
2. Open Git Bash

### Your Identity

The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address.

<aside>
üì¢ This is important because every Git commit uses this information

</aside>

```bash
git config --global user.name "Andrew Late"
git config --global user.email seeWhatIdidThere@haha.com
```

<aside>
üì¢ ¬†<code>--global</code> option - Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the¬†`--global` option when you‚Äôre in that project.

</aside>

### Checking Your Settings

```bash
git config --list
```

### Getting Help

```bash
# 1
git help <command>

# 2
git <command> --help

#Example
git help add
```

## The PAY ATTENTION moment begins here!

### The 3 States

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged and committed:

- **Modified** means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
- **Staged** means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
- **Committed** means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

<aside>
This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project:

1. **The Working Directory** - One Version of the project that can be used or modified.
2. **Staging Area** - Stores information about what will go into your next commit.
3. **.git directory(Repository)**- Contains all the commits.
</aside>

![3 States](./assets/3-states.png)

<aside>
<strong>Basic Workflowgi</strong>

1. You modify files in your working tree.
2. You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds¬†***only***¬†those changes to the staging area.
3. You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.
</aside>

### Status of Files

Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: **Tracked** or **Untracked.**

- Tracked files consists of **Unmodified**, **Modified** and **Staged** files.
- Untracked files are **everything else.**

When you perform `git init` all files present in the working directly are **Untracked.**

![Status of Files](./assets/file-status.png)

### Checking the Status of Files

The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state.

```bash
git status
```

To do: 

1. Add a new file
2. Now run the git status command

![Output of git status](./assets/git-status.png)

You can see that your new¬†`index.html` file is untracked because it‚Äôs under the ‚ÄúUntracked files‚Äù heading in your status output. An untracked file basically means that Git doesn't know about it and will only track the file if you explicitly tell it to do so.

### Tracking New Files

Let‚Äôs start tracking the new file that we added.

```bash
git add <file_name>

# To add Everything, literally
git add -A

# To make it interactive
git add -p
```

To begin tracking the `index.html` file, <br> you can run the `git add index.html` command. Now, if you run the status command again: 

![Output of git-add](./assets/git-add.png)

You can see that your¬†`index.html` file is now **tracked and staged to be committed.**

<aside>
<strong>You want to know exactly what you changed?</strong> <br>
Use the `git diff` command.
</aside>

### Committing Changes

Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your changes. 

<aside>
<strong>Remember</strong>

- Any files you have **created** or **modified** that you haven‚Äôt run¬†`git add`
¬†on since you edited them‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâwon‚Äôt go into this commit. They will stay as modified on your disk.

- Every time you perform a commit, you‚Äôre recording a **snapshot** of your project that you can revert to or compare to later.
</aside>

To commit the changes, the following command is used:

```bash
git commit <filename> -m "<Message>"

# Committing the whole staging area
git commit -m "<Message>"
```

In our case, run `git commit -m ‚ÄúAdded: HTML file‚Äù`

![Output of git commit](./assets/git-commit.png)

**Observations**

Now you‚Äôve created your first commit! You can see that the commit has given you some output about itself: 

- Which branch you committed to ‚áí `master`
- What SHA-1 checksum the commit has ‚áí `ae8a85c`
- How many files were changed, and statistics about lines added and removed in the commit.

Let‚Äôs create a couple of commits.

![Less informative commit messages](./assets/commit-messages.png)

### Viewing the Commit History

After you have created several commits, you‚Äôll probably want to look back to see what has happened. The following command helps you do it:

```bash
git log

# Also prints the list of modified files, and their details
git log --stat

# Limit to "n" entries
git log -n

# Printing each commit on a single line
git log --oneline
```

Let‚Äôs run `git log` on our machine.

![Logging Commits](./assets/git-log.png)

**Observations**

- By default, `git log` lists the commits made in that repository in reverse chronological order (i.e., the most recent commits show up first.)
- The command lists each commit with its
    1. SHA-1 checksum, 
    2. Author‚Äôs name and email, 
    3. Date, and 
    4. Commit message.

<aside>
<strong>The hell is HEAD?</strong>

 HEAD tells you:

- What branch you're currently one,
- What the next parent will be (cuz HEAD is now the pointing to the parent of the next commit).
</aside>

### Removing Commits / Going back

The following command is used to go back:

```bash
git reset <commit_hash>

# Reset to previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD^
```

Let's Understand

![Initiating reset](./assets/reset-1.png)

After doing `git reset b` , now the HEAD and Main are pointing to the commit ‚Äúb‚Äù.

![Ending reset](./assets/reset-end.png)

### Undoing Things

At any stage, you may want to undo something. Here, we‚Äôll review a few basic tools for undoing changes that you‚Äôve made.

<aside>
<strong>Be careful, because you can‚Äôt always undo some of these undos.</strong> 
This is one of the few areas in Git where you may lose some work if you do it wrong.
</aside>

- **Case 1: When you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message.**
    
    If you want to redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the¬†`--amend` option.
    
    ```bash
    git commit --amend -m "<Message>"
    ```
    
    This command takes your staging area and uses it for the commit. 
    
    <aside>
    <strong>If you‚Äôve made no changes since your last commit</strong> (for instance, you run this command immediately after your previous commit), then
    
    your snapshot will look exactly the same, and all you‚Äôll change is your commit message.
    </aside>
    
- **Case 2: To unstage a staged file**
    
    The nice part is that the `git status` reminds you how to undo changes to them.
    
    ```bash
    git restore --staged <file>
    ```
    
- **Case 3: Unmodifying a modified file**
    
    What if you realize that you don‚Äôt want to keep your changes to a file that you just modified? 
    
    Luckily, `git status` tells you how to do that too.
    
    ```bash
    git restore <file>
    ```

## Conclusion

If you‚Äôve made it this far, you already are acquainted with the basics of Git. 

Its totally alright if you don‚Äôt remember the commands, just make sure you understand what is happening at each stage and you‚Äôll be good to go.
