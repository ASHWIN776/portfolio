I'm always looking for problems to solve. But here's the thing, I've lost count of how many golden opportunities I've missed just by not acting on them. They sit there, pending, and eventually the excitement fades.                                                                                        

Here's what I've learned: **you can turn ideas into reality incredibly fast if you capitalize on the momentum from the moment you think of them**. That initial spark? That's your superpower. The trick is actually using it. 

The problem? 

**Building an [**MVP**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) feels overwhelming and chaotic**. So I either don't start, or I start and never finish.

I discovered the solution in [How to build anything extremely quickly](https://learnhowtolearn.org/how-to-build-extremely-quickly), strongly recommend reading it. My article just captures notes and key insights.

	title='Solution - Outline Speedrunning'
>
Recursively outline an MVP, speedrun filling it in, and only then go back and perfect.
</Callout>
### The Process

1. Make an outline of the project.

2. For each item in the outline, make an outline. Do this recursively until the items are small.

3. Fill in each item as fast as possible.

	- You’ll get more momentum by speedrunning it, which feels great, and will make you even more productive

	- **DO NOT PERFECT AS YOU GO**. This is a huge and common mistake.

4. Finally, once completely done, go back and perfect

	- Color the title text, figure out if buttons should have 5% or 6% border radius, etc

	- Since you’re done, you’ll be less stressed, have a much clearer mind, and design your project better

### Example - "Building a Personal Portfolio Website"

1. Recursively outline the MVP 
	Level 1 outline (Pages needed):
	- Home page
	- About page
	- Projects page
	- Work Experience page
	
	Level 2 outline (Projects page):
	- Project Cards
	- Individual Project Details
	- Filters/categories
	
	Level 3 (Project cards):
	- Title
	- Description
	- Technologies used
	- Link/demo
1. Lock In and build the outlines (Basic styles, focus on content)
2. Deploy - get it live
3. Now, go and perfect
