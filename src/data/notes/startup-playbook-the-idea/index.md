It’s better not to try too actively to force yourself to come up with startup ideas.

Instead, 

1. Learn about a lot of different things.
2. Practice noticing problems, things that seem inefficient, and major technological shifts. 
3. Work on projects you find interesting.
4. Go out of your way to hang around smart, interesting people. At some point, ideas will emerge.
